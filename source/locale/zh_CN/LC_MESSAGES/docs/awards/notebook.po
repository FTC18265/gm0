"A trap many teams fall into is that a longer notebook is a better notebook, "
"especially if it's actually quality writing. Unfortunately, that is not "
"necessarily true."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/awards/notebook.rst:14
msgid ""
"At shorter competitions, judges don't have a lot of time to read your "
"notebooks. They will likely take a cursory scan at every page and take a more "
"detailed look at certain pages. Thus, even if you do write a great but long "
"notebook, they might miss the highlights and rank you lower than you should "
"have. The solution to this is to create a condensed notebook."

"This is where you make a purposeful effort to get rid of redundancies and make "
"sure everything written in the notebook serves the purpose of being read and "

msgid ""
"This one is a team decision. Some teams swear judges prefer handwritten "
"notebooks, but there is no proof for that. But if you're a small team or you "
"would prefer to write, do that. Be sure that the handwriting is consistent and "
"legible! Typed notebooks are a lot easier to organize, and judges will "
"definitely be able to read them."

"You should try and reflect that in your notebook. Neither way is better, but "
