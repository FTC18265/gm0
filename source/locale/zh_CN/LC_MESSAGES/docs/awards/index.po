"This is the part of |gm0| that discusses awards. Awards exist in parallel"
" to the robot game and serves as an alternate way to advance. While the "
"majority of |gm0| talks about how to make decisions about creating your "
"robot, the notebook you write is actually showing how you made those "
"decisions."

"**It only benefits you to go for awards. You can't win awards without "
"writing a notebook, and in certain states the only way to advance is "
"awards and in others it can make it significantly easier to advance.** "
"Therefore, these are the topics that will be covered in this section of "
"|gm0|."

"Judging and awards are extremely subjective and some rules change a bit "
"from state to state. What works in one region may not in other regions. "
"So contact your judges about specifics of some things; for example some "
"competitions allow you to turn a custom control award sheet, others only "
"accept the one listed by *FIRST*\\ |reg|. The writers of this part of "
"|gm0| have extensive experience with awards and have even been winners "
"and finalists for the Inspire Award at the World Championships."

"For most awards, teams have a 5 minute presentation at the beginning of "
"the day followed by some Q&A time and possibly pit judging later on (read"
" the section on the judging process for more detail). There are 7 awards "
"for FTC teams (excluding awards that cannot advance a team)."

"Overall, awards are one of the core parts of the *FIRST*\\ |reg| Tech "
"Challenge competition. They recognize teams at the end of every "
"competition (except league meets) as well as determine many of the teams "
"that advance."
