"Actobotics provides a great value fixed pitch build system that is "

"systems which require cutting :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` to length."
msgstr ""

"Actobotics has the patented :term:`Servoblocks`, which help drastically "

"Actobotics is more sturdy than TETRIX in terms of drivetrain flex and has"
" more support options to prevent structural bending."

#: ../../source/docs/hardware-components/kit-and-hardware-guide/actobotics.rst:43
msgid ""
"The :term:`clamping hubs <Clamping Hub>` offered are more reliable than "
":term:`set screws <Set Screw>`, as clamping engages the shaft in more "
"places than a :term:`set screw <Set Screw>` (one face). As discussed in "
"the :doc:`TETRIX section <tetrix>`, set screws in particular are "
"vulnerable to loosening, especially without application of Loctite."

"Actobotics’ motion system is **very** robust and relies on :term:`ball "
"bearings <Ball Bearing>`, which have a lower coefficient of friction than"
" bushings. Actobotics is compatible with the 5mm hex used by REV with "
"their adaptable hubs."

"Actobotics is not very cheap, so its cost may be prohibitive for some "

"The :term:`belts <HTD Belt>` from ServoCity are not great. It is "
"recommended that :term:`belts <HTD Belt>` are purchased from vendors "
"other than ServoCity. This may necessitate 3D printed belt pulleys and "
"other parts, which is more difficult for newer teams. There also isn’t a "
"large amount of space inside the channel for a belt or chain run, vastly "
"limiting the size of the pulleys."

":term:`Channel` takes up more space than :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>`, "

"similar size as :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>`."
