"Many teams elect to ignore kits entirely and instead make their own "
"mechanisms completely from scratch. While this allows for nearly "
"unlimited design freedom, keep in mind *full* Custom has many caveats and"
" drawbacks. A full CAD model is required for a custom robot, as well as "
"machining capability. Custom robots are not suitable for a new team."

"However, forgoing a full custom robot opens up many opportunities. Many "
"teams choose to create a robot that is a mix of kit parts and custom "
"parts. Our recommendation is to use kit parts as the backbone of the "
"robot, and custom fabricate any additional parts necessary, instead of "
"the other way around. That way, you can rely on the strength and "
"durability of the kit while retaining the ability to customize small "
"pieces and mechanisms to your advantage."

"The methods that teams use to make custom parts typically involve either "
"additive or subtractive manufacturing: either building a part from raw "
"material (3d printing) or removing material from stock to create a part "
"(Milling, Routing, and Laser Cutting)."
