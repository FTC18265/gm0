"Before beginning your season, your team is presented with a crucial "
"decision - one that will undoubtedly heavily influence the team’s "
"direction of hardware design in at least the first year. The *FIRST*\\ "
"|reg| storefront currently offers two kits for new teams: the TETRIX kit "
"from Pitsco, and the REV Starter kit from REV Robotics. However, teams "
"should carefully consider other options, such as Actobotics from "
"Servocity and goBILDA, before selecting a kit."

"Every build system has advantages and disadvantages, which we have "
"highlighted in our detailed build system guides below. While the guide "
"may not be fully objective, recommendations are based on our own "
"experience with the different kits, so the slant is there with reason. As"
" with pretty much anything in FTC, there is no one right answer - but "
"there are better answers than others. Hopefully, this guide gives some "
"solid advice on which kit might be the best for your team."

"After all, plenty of successful robots have not followed this framework. "
"However, we still recommend new teams purchase a starter kit for one big "
"reason. Established teams are all but guaranteed to have spare parts "
"lying around to use to build their next bot. However, rookie teams, as is"
" obvious, don’t have the plethora of parts from previous seasons to use. "
"Thus, new teams should purchase these parts themselves in order to have "
"something to build from once the season starts, and starter kits offer "
"these parts for less money than they would be if bought individually. As "
"will be discussed, options that don’t involve kits exist and are "
"certainly very useful, but sticking to parts designed for FTC is "
"recommended for new teams as a starting point."

"Choice of a kit is a matter of many a debate in FTC forums, and each team"
" has their favorites. If you are a rookie team and do not have any "
"experience with any of the kits above, we would recommend starting with a"
" kit from either REV Robotics or goBILDA. These kits provide a good "
"selection of parts, reliability, and value for money. They are easily "
"expandable and great part flexibility allows for customization. Keep in "
"mind that compatibility between kits varies and will be impacted by the "
"unit system used."

"REV Robotics (metric) is slightly cheaper but generally has a bit higher "
"learning curve than most other kits, as it is :term:`extrusion "
"<Extrusion>` rather than :term:`channel <Channel>` based. "
":term:`Extrusion` takes more effort to work with (you need to cut "
"aluminum extrusion to length); however, it allows for maximum design "
"freedom and adjustability. REV is also available from the *FIRST*\\ |reg|"
" storefront, which might be convenient for teams doing their purchasing "
"through official school procurement systems."

"goBILDA (metric) is slightly more expensive, but is easier to get started"
" with. It has an extensive parts catalog and can be adapted to other "
"build systems like REV. However, its price point may deter some teams "
"with lesser budgets."

"Tetrix (metric and imperial) is probably the simplest system to work "
"with, but its part selection is limited, and the use of :term:`4.7mm "
"shaft <Shaft>` with :term:`set screws <Set Screw>` is inferior to "
":term:`clamping hubs <Clamping Hub>` used in other systems."

"Actobotics (imperial) is similar to goBILDA, being made by the same "
"company. It has always been a solid option with reliable parts. For most "
"FTC teams, goBILDA would probably be a better choice as it is more "
"flexible and compatible, unless you already have a large stock of "
"Actobotics parts."
