"The TETRIX build system revolves around 32 mm aluminum :term:`c-channels "
"<Channel>` and a 16mm bolt circle, on 16mm spacing (centers of the "
"circles are 16mm apart). TETRIX is patterned along these :term:`channels "
"<Channel>` to create many mounting options for building structures."

"These channels have a tendency to flex and bend under load, often "

"While TETRIX :term:`channel <Channel>` is measured in metric units, the "

"While you may be considering TETRIX as a starter kit, we encourage you to"
" explore your options before selecting a kit. While Tetrix does pick up "
"quite a lot of flak from the community, it isn’t a bad choice in terms of"
" physical qualities such as strength, but the mounting options and hole "
"patterns leave more to be desired and restrict teams in terms of "
"flexibility."

"The TETRIX kit, being the most basic of all kit options, is easy to learn"
" and provides a variety of options in building. The kit itself comes with"
" :term:`c-channel <Channel>`, which is aluminum shaped in a C. It has "
"pre-cut holes so motors, :term:`gears <Gear>`, or :term:`drive shafts "
"<Shaft>` can be seamlessly integrated into the channel. For a beginner "
"team with little to no experience, a TETRIX kit allows you to assemble a "
"working drivetrain in a couple of hours (Note: Most other kits allow you "
"to do the same thing, but with more customization options)."

"Furthermore, TETRIX is decent in terms of structural integrity, as long "
"as the channels are loaded in the correct orientation. Typically, the "
"orientation should be like an “n”, with the top face upward. Connecting "
"the channels with :term:`locknut <Locknut>` instead of regular nuts aids "
"in longevity. However, TETRIX is the weakest of the build systems and is "
"very prone to bending, especially with long pieces of channel that have "
"multiple axes of load."

"The TorqueNADO motors are comparable with :term:`NeveRest <NeveRest "
"Motor>` 60:1. They are usable, however have more limited uses due to "
"their slow :term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>`, which means high torque "
"but relatively slow output speed. The TorqueNADO uses spur gearboxes, and"
" will not handle as much shock load as other planetary options, namely "
":term:`AndyMark 20 Orbitals <NeveRest Motor>`, :term:`REV HD Planetary "
"<HD Hex Motor>`, or the :term:`goBILDA Yellow Jacket Planetaries <Yellow "

"TETRIX hubs are :term:`6mm or 4.7mm round <Shaft>` and are based on "
":term:`set screws <Set Screw>` which are torque transferring. These "
":term:`set screws <Set Screw>` are notorious for coming loose under load,"
" so special care must be taken to continuously tighten these screws. "
"Additionally, it is highly recommended that teams use some sort of "
"threadlocker on set screws, whether it be :term:`Loctite Blue (removable)"
" or Loctite Red (nonremovable) <Loctite>`. A possible workaround is "
"purchasing 6mm D :term:`clamping hubs <Clamping Hub>` from goBILDA to use"
" on TETRIX :term:`shafts <Shaft>`, however, this also necessitates the "
"use of a pattern adapter from the goBILDA pattern to TETRIX."

"Due to using a metric based pattern but using imperial based holes and "
":term:`chain <Chain>` standards, :term:`chain <Chain>` will not have "

"TETRIX is also the most expensive kit on average while providing the most"

msgid ""
"In any build system, it is important to properly support the structure of"
" your robot. This includes supporting axles at two or more points of "
"contact, or having multiple points of support for a piece of "
":term:`channel <Channel>`. Due to TETRIX’s relatively fragile nature, "
"this advice goes double with TETRIX. Instead of just supporting a "
":term:`shaft <Shaft>` at two points, it is recommended to support the "
":term:`shaft <Shaft>` at 4 or more (if you are using a 4.7mm standard). "
"When mounting motors, it is recommended that :term:`two clamping motor "
"mounts <Clamp Mounting>` are used to mount one motor. Using "
":term:`standoffs <Standoff>` inside :term:`channel <Channel>` to prevent "
"the :term:`channel <Channel>` from bending inward or outward is also "
"highly recommended."
