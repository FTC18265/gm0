"Below is a collection of tips and tricks on basic building. Some of them "
"may seem obvious, but almost every FTC newbie made these mistakes at "
"least once."

"**Color code your tools**. If you are using several different sizes of "
"hex drivers (e.g. 2.5 mm and 3 mm used in goBILDA), color code them, "
"using different color electric tape for different sizes."

"**Avoid set screws**. :term:`Set screws <Set Screw>` easily come loose, "
"causing the hub to slip. In addition, :term:`set screws <Set Screw>` "
"damage the :term:`axle <Shaft>`, sometimes making it very hard to remove "
"the hub later. For these reasons, whenever possible, use :term:`clamping "
"hubs <Clamping Hub>` and collars instead of :term:`set screw <Set Screw>`"
" ones. If you must use set screw hubs, use a non-permanent threadlocker "
"such as `Loctite blue <https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products"
"/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_threadlockerblue242.html>`_ to "
"prevent them from loosening."

"**Only use locknuts**. Never use regular nuts in your builds - they "
"easily come loose under vibration. Kep nuts used in TETRIX are better, "
"but they are still prone to loosening. For best results, always use "
":term:`nylon locknuts <Locknut>`."

"**Do not use socket head screws on plastic**. Using socket head screws "
"for attaching plastic parts (in particular, for attaching servos) damages"
" the plastic. Use button head screws instead, or use socket head screws "
"withwashers."

msgid ""
"**Make sure screws are not hitting anything**. When you are attaching a "
"part, make sure the screw you are using is not longer than the depth of "
"the threaded hole - otherwise, the screw will hit the bottom of the hole "
"and you will be unable to tighten it properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This situation commonly happens when attaching parts to a :term:`t-slot "
"extrusion <Extrusion>` (Misumi, REV, goBILDA's goRAIL) - if the screw is "
"too long, it will hit the bottom of the slot, and no matter how hard you "
"try, you won't get a tight connection. Another case when this situation "
"arises is when using attachment blocks where two screw holes intersect - "
"if you are not careful, you could have one screw hitting another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware-components/tips-and-tricks.rst:13
msgid ""
"**Do not connect two components which both have threaded holes**. To get "
"tight connection, the screw should go through an **unthreaded** hole in "
"one component into a **threaded** hole in another, or through two "
"unthreaded holes into a nut."

"**Removing stripped screws**. A common problem is removing a screw in "
"which the hex socket head is damaged or worn out and thus the regular hex"
" driver doesn't provide enough holding power to loosen the screw. Here "
"are some ways to deal with the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Get a better hex driver. Hex driver can also be worn out, especially ball"
" head hex drivers. Get a new hex driver (not ball head), which is not yet"
" worn out, and it might give you more traction with stubborn screws."

"Put a rubber band between the tip of the hex driver and the socket. This "
"increases the traction."

"Use a hacksaw or a Dremel to cut a slot in the screw head, turning it "
