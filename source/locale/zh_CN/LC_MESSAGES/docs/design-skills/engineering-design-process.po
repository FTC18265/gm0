"As an example, let’s look at an imaginary team building a drivetrain for "
"Rover Ruckus (RR2), which was 2018-2019’s game. In RR2, there was a "
"crater, which was about 3” tall, and could be traversed. In that year’s "
"game, there were two main options: traverse said crater, or not traverse "
"it, and instead reach over with an arm."

"The team must first specify requirements for the drivetrain. One of the "
"most important aspects of a drivetrain is maneuverability. Another "
"requirement could be speed, traction, reliability, etc. From the team’s "
"specified requirements, they would now look at drivetrains that fit their"
" requirements. If the team wanted to traverse the crater, then a 4WD or "
"6WD would be an optimal design. If they did not need to traverse the "
"crater, many options are still on the table such as the holonomic "
"drivetrains."

"The next step would be to brainstorm actual designs. It would be prudent "
"to have more than one student to design one drivetrain prototype, so that"
" the team could test more than one drivetrain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/design-skills/engineering-design-process.rst:45
msgid ""
"From there, a team could begin the prototyping and testing process. This "
"could involve tests of the time taken to cross the crater, time from "
"crater to lander, top speed, maneuverability, etc. Simple tests may be "
"conducted instead of complicated ones. For example, if the robot is "
"projected to weigh 30 pounds, a dumbbell placed on top of the drivetrain "
"simulates the extra weight well to see if the drivetrain can get over the"
" crater easily and reliably, so the robot will not get stuck on the "
"crater edge."

#: ../../source/docs/design-skills/engineering-design-process.rst:47
msgid ""
"Next, analyze results and iterate. If, for example, there was too little "
"clearance, and the drivetrain got stuck on the crater part of the time, "
"then it would be necessary to raise the drivebase in order to remediate "
"this problem. However, don’t change too many things at once - **you want "
"to change ONLY ONE variable at a time**, or else you won’t know what may "
"cause a further problem should it arise. Always try to change one "
"variable at a time."

"**It often takes multiple iterations to get things right, so don’t be "
"discouraged if your second or even third attempt doesn’t perform as well "
"as you think it will**. Many teams have 10+ iterations of intake designs "
"in order to refine and hone down their design to be optimally efficient. "
"While that many tries isn’t recommended for new teams, don’t be afraid to"
" modify *one factor* at a time to isolate and solve problems."
