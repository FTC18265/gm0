"Starting off, choose a CAD program and learn it as well as possible. It "
"may be a good idea to spend a few weeks just finding objects lying "
"around, sit down with a ruler or calipers, and make a quick CAD model. A "
"good way to test accuracy is to choose a solid object made up of one "
"known material. Weigh the object and make the model in CAD, apply that "
"material to it, and see what the weight difference is. This is a good way"
" to test how accurate the CAD model is to the real part. It really "
"doesn't matter what object it is - just find something and make it to the"
" best of your abilities. There are also tons of videos on YouTube; a good"
" one is TFI who makes detailed tutorials for Autodesk Inventor."
