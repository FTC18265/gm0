"Perhaps the biggest barrier when making a fully custom robot is that it "
"requires very expensive manufacturing equipment. While 3D printers have "
"become more and more common in FTC and allow teams to create or customize"
" small parts, many teams do not have access to equipment such as lathes, "
"routers, waterjet cutters, or CNC machines."

"Fully custom robots need to be fully designed in CAD. Sketching will not "
"cut it when building custom robots."

"Another barrier is that prototyping with fully custom systems is almost "
"always much slower than using kit parts. The full CAD process takes time,"
" and fabrication/getting parts fabricated by a shop or sponsor is another"
" lengthy process. Notwithstanding those two factors, if something goes "
"drastically wrong then it will require a repeat process of CAD and "
"fabrication."

"It must be noted that teams do not need to pick between a fully kit-based"
" robot or a fully custom robot. In fact, many successful teams are "
"actually a hybrid of both kit and custom parts, as can be seen in many of"
" example robots in this section."

"However, our suggestion is that inexperienced teams should prioritize 3D "
"printing over machining for fabricating custom parts, at least for the "
"near term."
