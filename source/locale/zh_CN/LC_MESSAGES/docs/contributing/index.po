"**These goals do not necessarily build upon each other.** For example, "
"let’s look at the :doc:`/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/index` section. "
"If we want to simply guide more rookie teams on a path to become "
"successful, we would discuss the very popular drivetrains that teams may "
"encounter (2WD, 4WD, 6WD, mecanum, X-Drive, and H-Drive) so that teams "
"can quickly get up to speed and choose a competitive drivetrain. "
"However, if the goal is to be a comprehensive reference, we would "
"include every single possible drivetrain ever created for FTC, even if "
"they aren’t very competitive or realistic for newer teams to build "
"(swerve, ball, octocanum, etc)."
msgstr ""
"- **这些目标不一定是相互建立的。**例如，让我们看一下:doc:`/docs/robot-"
"design/drivetrains/index`部分。如果我们想简单地引导更多的新手团队走上成功"
"之路，我们将会讨论团队可能遇到的非常流行的传动系统（2WD、4WD、6WD、"
"mecanum、X-Drive和H-Drive），以便团队能够快速上手，选择更具有竞争力的系"
"统。然而，如果目标是成为一个全面的参考，我们将包括有史以来为FTC创造的每一"

"objective, repeatable reasoning. For more information on this, read the :"

"in the electronics sections, we do not discuss how to exactly wire the "
