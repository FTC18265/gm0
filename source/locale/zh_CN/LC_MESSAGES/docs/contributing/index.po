"Hello, and thank you for taking the time to consider contributing to "

"|gm0| welcomes contributions from basically anybody. The majority of this"
" guide was written by accomplished students of FTC from a wide variety of"
" teams, alongside mentors and alums. Our editorial control is based "
"purely on content, as long as the content is good, it’ll be added to "
"|gm0|."

"Before writing, please take the time to familiarize yourself with the "

"To inform and guide newer teams, participants, and coaches of the FIRST "
"Tech Challenge and help them achieve their competitive goals."
msgstr ""

"To act as a living reference for mechanisms, techniques, and community "
"knowledge pertinent to FIRST Tech Challenge."

"These goals may seem relatively self-explanatory, but they have several "
"important takeaways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/contributing/index.rst:24
msgid ""
"**These goals do not necessarily build upon each other.** For example, "
"let’s look at the :doc:`/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/index` section. If"
" we want to simply guide more rookie teams on a path to become "
"successful, we would discuss the very popular drivetrains that teams may "
"encounter (2WD, 4WD, 6WD, mecanum, X-Drive, and H-Drive) so that teams "
"can quickly get up to speed and choose a competitive drivetrain. However,"
" if the goal is to be a comprehensive reference, we would include every "
"single possible drivetrain ever created for FTC, even if they aren’t very"
" competitive or realistic for newer teams to build (swerve, ball, "
"octocanum, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/contributing/index.rst:26

"We are seeking to accomplish both goals with a new structure: there will "
"be a “For Rookies” page, that will link to a list of curated pages "
"designed for rookies, while pages outside this list can act as more "
"comprehensive references."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/contributing/index.rst:27

"Keep the goal of the page and whether it is designed to be kept on the "
"“For Rookies” page in mind while writing, and adjust the content "
"accordingly."

"**Game Manual 0 is a guide from primarily a competitive standpoint.** In "
"general our recommendations have the end goal of increasing the points "
"scored by a team while working inside a team’s limitations, and building "
"good technical habits that will be useful in a future career."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/contributing/index.rst:30
msgid ""
"**Game Manual 0 seeks to inform, not tell.** |gm0| does not wish to "
"encourage one “meta” design or series of techniques, instead, the guide "
"seeks to present teams with a variety of options, with a pros and cons "
"list of each, and let teams make their own decisions for their own "
"circumstances. If recommendations are given, they must be based on "
"objective, repeatable reasoning. For more information on this, read the "
":doc:`style-guide`."

msgid ""
"**Game Manual 0 is generally a high level concept guide.** This means "
"that information is given in a way that is applicable to many situations,"
" rather than a series of steps. However, when possible we link to "
"external documentation to plug any knowledge gaps. For example: in the "
"electronics sections, we do not discuss how to exactly wire the robot "
"using the REV control system, instead we link to the REV documentation "
"for exact wiring and discuss general wiring best practices."
