"For example, we all know Tetrix V2 Motors are bad. But don't just say "
"they're bad, say: \"Tetrix V2 motors are underpowered and often burn in "
"a few seconds under stall, which is why they are not generally "
"recommended. They also do not have built in encoders. We would highly "
"recommend purchasing RS-550/RS-555 class motors being sold by goBILDA, "
"REV, and AndyMark instead.\""

"Similarly, we know the goBILDA motors are generally good. But *explain* "
"why they are good, e.g. \"goBILDA Yellow Jacket Planetary motors are "
"generally recommended if you need a 6mm D/8mm REX output shaft motor, "
"and especially if you use goBILDA as your primary build system. These "
"motors have a robust gearbox that generally can handle a decent amount "
"of shock load (but they still must be supported in high torque "
"situations) and conveniently face mount into goBILDA parts. "
"Additionally, goBILDA motors do not require the use of a level shifter "
"to use its encoders with the REV control system for flexibility. Please "
"note that you will need to adapt the bullet connectors to the REV "
"control system power cables, and the goBILDA motor power cables are not "
"removable, unlike the REV Robotics motors.\""

"For example: TETRIX structure has a bad reputation for bending at times, "
