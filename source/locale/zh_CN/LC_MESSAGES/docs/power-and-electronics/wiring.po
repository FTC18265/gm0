"Have you ever looked inside your robot and thought \"what a mess of "
"wires\"? Wiring is extremely important in FTC, but is often overlooked or"
" hastily done the hour before competition starts. However, time spent in "
"wiring the robot properly is crucial to the performance and maintenance "
"of the robot."

"While tedious and often no fun, wiring can mean the difference between a "
"win and loss. The best robot in the world won't be able to work if a wire"
" is loose or gets tangled up in the middle of a match. Thus it is "
"imperative that wiring is purposefully thought out when designing and "
"building a robot."

"**Keep wires tucked away from moving mechanisms,** and ensure that you "
"will not be at risk of a mechanism snagging a wire. This is a proper "
