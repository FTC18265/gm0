"In the past, the Xbox 360 controller was preferred by many top teams over"
" the Logitech F310. This is mostly as the Xbox controller has less of a "
"dead spot. A dead spot is basically the area where the joystick can move "
"but not communicate that the stick has shifted slightly. This means that "
"when the joystick is moved to a position where the controller can detect "
"it, the robot will sometimes have a tendency to lurch forward. Dead spots"
" make it difficult for the driver to execute fine-tuned and precise "
"movements. **This is likely a non-issue for the large majority of teams. "
"Also, keep in mind that there are very specific models of the Xbox "
"controller that are legal, so they can be hard to find new.**"

"Starting with the 2020-2021 season, the ETPark and Sony PS4 Controllers "
"are legal and provide numerous advantages over Xbox 360 Controllers. Some"
" of these advantages include, better trigger and bumper control, a more "
"usable dpad, and trackpad support as of the 2021-2022 season. Use of the "
"PS4 controller is slightly different because the locations of the Left "
"Stick and DPAD are swapped and `some button names are different. "

"Generally it is the opinion that the PS4 controllers are better than the "
"other options. Among the options for PS4 controllers, the choice is "
"really up to you. The Sony controller has slightly better buttons, but "
"the ETPark controller is half the cost and a more solid connecting wire. "
"**Keep in mind that the drivers can use different controllers, so pick "
"the one most comfortable to you.**"
