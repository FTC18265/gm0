":term:`Servos <Servo>` that can rotate to a given position based on PWM "
"input signal are called **regular servos**. In addition, there are also "
"**continuous rotation servos**, which are effectively just small motors "

"Both REV Smart Servo and goBILDA Dual Mode servos (which are both based "

":term:`Servo` output power is measured in both **speed** and **torque**. "
"Speed (normally in seconds per 60°) refers to how fast the :term:`servo "
"<Servo>` turns 60 degrees in Standard Rotation mode. Torque (usually "
"measured in oz-in or in kg-cm) refers to the amount of force the "
":term:`servo <Servo>` can apply to a lever."

"For reference, if you put a 1” bar on a servo, then put a force gauge on "
"the end, the torque rating of the servo (in oz-in) will be measured. As "
"you may know, speed and torque have an inverse relationship. Generally, "
"you can find some insanely powerful servos that are pretty slow (slower "
"than 0.20 s/60°) or some less powerful ones with faster ratios (anything "

"Shock load from reversing directions on an object that is too heavy can "
