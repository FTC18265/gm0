":term:`Servo` wires usually are black-red-white. Matching the colors is "
"an easy way to check if the servo is plugged in correctly. :term:`Servo` "
"connectors provide no protection from plugging them the wrong way: if you"
" rotate it 180 degrees, it will still fit - but the :term:`servo <Servo>`"
" would not work. (It wouldn't be damaged, though). Thus, if your "
":term:`servo <Servo>` is not working, first check if they are plugged in "
"correctly. Then check it again."

"When using :term:`servo <Servo>` wire extensions, use `retaining clips "
"<https://www.gobilda.com/servo-connector-clip-yellow-6-pack/>`_ to "
"prevent the connection from coming apart when someone pulls on the wire. "
"Alternatively, electrical tape will work in a pinch."

":term:`Servos <Servo>` break very easily when subjected to lateral loads "
"or bending of the :term:`shaft <Shaft>`. For example, if you mount an arm"
" or a claw directly on the :term:`servo <Servo>` without any additional "
"precautions, it is very likely that you will break the :term:`servo "
"<Servo>` first time you drive into the wall with the arm extended (and "
"this will inevitably happen)."

"To avoid that, use additional supports. The easiest way to do it is by "
"using :term:`Servoblocks` from Actobotics or goBILDA. These assemblies "
"act as exoskeletons for the :term:`servo <Servo>`, providing additional "
"support. They are expensive, but worth every penny. Additionally, REV "
"offers the inside and outside channel :term:`servo <Servo>` bracket, "
"which when paired with the aluminum servo :term:`shaft <Shaft>` adapter "
"and :term:`bearing <Ball Bearing>` assembly, fulfills the same function."

"If you need more power, use `REV Servo Power Module "
"<https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1144/>`_. By itself, :term:`REV "
"Expansion Hub <Expansion Hub>` provides 5V power to servos, and the "
"current is limited to 2A for each of 3 pairs of servo ports (0-1, 2-3, "
"4-5). Since stall current on a servo such as goBILDA Dual Mode servo is "
"about 2.5A, it means that if one of the servos in a pair is stalled, the "
"other one will not be getting enough power to maintain its position. The "
":term:`REV Servo Power Module <Servo Power Module>` provides 6V and up to"
" 15A current total for 6 :term:`servo <Servo>` ports."
