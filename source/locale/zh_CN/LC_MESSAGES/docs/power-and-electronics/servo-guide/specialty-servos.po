"This large scale :term:`servo <Servo>` is unusual in that it is able to "
"rotate multiple turns while retaining positioning feedback. Most "
":term:`servos <Servo>` have 180 degree range; for HS788, the range is "
"about 8 full turns when used with a :term:`servo <Servo>` controller "
"capable of 500-2500 microsecond PWM signal, such as :term:`REV Expansion "
"Hub <Expansion Hub>`. This makes it a great option for powering linear "
"slides (as long as they do not carry too heavy load)."

"This continuous rotation :term:`servo <Servo>` from Parallax "
"(https://www.parallax.com/product/high-speed-continuous-rotation-servo/) "
"has the speed of up to 180 RPM - three times as fast as most "
":term:`servos <Servo>`. This makes it usable for powering intakes "
"(assuming you do not need much torque) and similar designs. Note that "
"this :term:`servo <Servo>` requires 6V input, so it can not be used "
"directly with :term:`REV hubs <Expansion Hub>`, which only provide 5V. "
"Instead, you need a `REV Servo Power Module "

"The :term:`VEX 393 EDR` is technically a motor, but is legally counted as"
" a :term:`servo <Servo>` in Game Manual 1 rules. Why this is, we do not "
"know, but :term:`VEX 393 motors <VEX 393 EDR>` have been legal in FTC for"
" many years. The :term:`393 motor <VEX 393 EDR>` acts as a more powerful "
"and faster continuous rotation :term:`servo <Servo>`. It should be "
"treated as a continuous rotation :term:`servo <Servo>` when configuring "
"the robot and programming."

"However, there are some difficulties to keep in mind. The 393 motor uses "
"a 1/8\" square :term:`shaft <Shaft>`, which is not directly compatible "
"with any FTC build system. You will have to make custom adapters. Using a"
" :term:`393 motor <VEX 393 EDR>` requires two additional equipment."

"**REV Servo Power Module** The REV :term:`Servo Power Module` is used to "
"boost the voltage given to :term:`servos <Servo>` through the "
":term:`Expansion Hub` (3.3V) to 5V, which is the minimum voltage needed "
"to run a :term:`393 <VEX 393 EDR>`. The SPM accepts PWM signal through "
"the three-pronged wire end of the :term:`MC29 <VEX Motor Controller 29>`."
" The SPM will need to be plugged in to the :term:`Expansion Hub's "
"<Expansion Hub>` power through a Tamiya connector. Crimping ring "
"terminals to the SPM is necessary."
