"A :term:`servo <Servo>` combines a small electric motor and control "
"circuit in a single compact package. This allows the :term:`servo "
"<Servo>` to rotate to a specified position and hold that position. "
"Typically :term:`servos <Servo>` have limited range of rotation (180° is "
"common)."

"Servos are **NOT** replacements for DC motors, and should not be used as "
"such. Servos are made for fine-tuned and accurate movement, not high-load"
" or fast rotation applications."

":term:`Servos <Servo>` are commonly used in RC cars (steering) and RC "
"planes (moving ailerons). In FTC, :term:`servos <Servo>` are typically "
"used for claws, grabbers, and arms."

"There are many :term:`servos <Servo>` from different manufacturers, which"
" vary widely in price, performance and value. Fortunately, virtually all "
":term:`servos <Servo>` use the standard 3-wire connector, and accept the "
"same kind of controlling signal (PWM signal at 50 hz). Each :term:`REV "
"Expansion Hub <Expansion Hub>` provides 6 :term:`servo <Servo>` ports, so"
" you can plug in a :term:`servo <Servo>` from any manufacturer. Also, "
"there is a standard size for servos for FTC use, so mounts can be "
"interchanged between manufacturers."

"Commonly used :term:`servos <Servo>` used in FTC are the REV Smart Servo "
"and goBILDA Dual mode Servos (`25-2 <https://www.gobilda.com/2000-series-"
"dual-mode-servo-25-2/>`_) and (`25-3 <https://www.gobilda.com/2000"
"-series-dual-mode-servo-25-3-speed/>`_), but you should check out other "
":term:`servos <Servo>` as well. Picking the right :term:`servo <Servo>` "
"for your application is a question that’s almost impossible to give a "
"blanket answer for. To learn more, please read the :doc:`choosing-servo` "
"section."

"The most prevalent problem with :term:`servos <Servo>` is durability. "
"Internal :term:`servo <Servo>` gears in cheaper :term:`servos <Servo>` "
"strip easily when subjected to shock loads. :term:`Servos <Servo>` are "
"also poor at handling lateral loads or bending of the shaft. To avoid "
"having to frequently replace servos, choose ones with metal gears and use"
" :term:`Servoblocks` or your kit's equivalent to prolong longevity."
