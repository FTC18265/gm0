":term:`JST-VH` is probably easiest to use, as it is the same connector "

"AndyMark also use JST-XH encoder port; however, an additional problem is "

"recommended that you connect them using level shifters, available from "

"Note that the pattern of :term:`face mounting <Face Mounting>` holes is "
"different for different vendors. For example, goBILDA uses 4 M4 holes in "
"a square with side 16 mm, whereas AndyMark classic motors use 6 M3 holes "
"on a 31 mm diameter circle. Thus, face mounting NeveRest motors to "
"goBILDA parts requires use of special adapters, and vice versa. "
"Similarly, gearbox diameter also varies between motors, so when choosing "
"a :term:`clamping hub <Clamping Hub>`, make sure to use the right "
"diameter."
