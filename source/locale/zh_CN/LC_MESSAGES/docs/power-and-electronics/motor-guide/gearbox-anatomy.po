"Fundamentally, a gearbox is just a collection of gears and an enclosure "
"that connects them. Gearboxes have an **output ratio**, the final "
":term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>` between the motor input and the final"
" output :term:`shaft <Shaft>`. :term:`Gear ratios <Gear Reduction>` are "
"further explained in the glossary."

"In FTC, gearboxes may be more common than you think - every motor has a "
"gearbox attached to it. These gearboxes are one of the following two "
"types: spur or planetary. Below we give a detailed analysis of each of "
"these gearbox types. **Just for clarification, the gearboxes below are "
"separate from the base motor.**"

"Spur gearboxes are an arrangement of :term:`gear ratios <Gear "
"Reduction>`, often stacked to achieve a large compound ratio (e.g. 40:1)."
" Each individual ratio only has two :term:`gears <Gear>`- one may be 8:1,"
" another may be 5:1, but the final ratio will be 40:1. These gearboxes "
"are used in the Andymark NeveRest Classic series and goBILDA’s 5201 "
"series motors, as well as :term:`REV HD Hex Motors <HD Hex Motor>`. Due "
"to the nature of how these gearboxes are built, each reduction only has a"
" few teeth from each :term:`gear <Gear>` engaged, and those teeth carry "
"the entire load of the gearbox. It’s easy to damage a spur gearbox from "
"shock load, and if one :term:`gear <Gear>` breaks, the entire gearbox "
"will stop functioning."

"Planetary gearboxes use a more complex system of gears to achieve a "
"robust reduction in a compact space. In automotive engineering, planetary"
" gear sets can achieve a few different ratios without changing gear size,"
" but all planetary gearboxes that you will see in FTC only achieve one "
"gear ratio."

"Planetary gearboxes are used in the Andymark Orbital series, some REV HD "

"AndyMark sells a few aftermarket planetary gearboxes called NeveRest "
"Sport and 57 Sport, and VEXpro sells the customizable VersaPlanetary "
"gearbox. As you can see from the graphic below, there are more teeth "
"meshing per stage than in the spur gearbox."

"Backlash is lower than spur gearbox equivalents. Backlash is defined as "
"the clearance or lost motion caused by gaps between parts. This can "
"easily be explained through putting a wheel or gear on a motor shaft and "
"lightly rotating it. The part should be able to wiggle around a little "
"without having considerable force imparted on it. This is caused because "
"it is impossible for the gear teeth inside the gearbox to mesh perfectly,"
" and is the same for :term:`chain <Chain>` and :term:`sprockets "
"<Sprocket>`, or any other form of power transmission. However, planetary "
"gearboxes have less backlash as they have less stages of gears."
