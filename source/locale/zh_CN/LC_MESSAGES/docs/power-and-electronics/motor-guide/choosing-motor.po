"gearboxes - These planetary gearboxes were designed for FRC\\ |reg| use "

"the components, the gearbox is very easy to repair. Unlike other "
"gearboxes, almost every part is replaceable and can be purchased "
"separately. You can disassemble the gearbox from the motor-side, so "

"the pinion to a :term:`bare motor <Bare Motor>` is simple since it clamps"
" onto the motor shaft instead of a press fit like the other pinion gears."
