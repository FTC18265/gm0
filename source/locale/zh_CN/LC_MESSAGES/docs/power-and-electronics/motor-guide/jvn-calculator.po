"The JVN Design calculator for FTC allows teams to calculate the "
":term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>` that is necessary for a mechanism "
"like a drivetrain or arm. This is a very valuable resource for picking "
"appropriate gear ratios for almost every application you need. It was "
"developed by `John V-Neun <https://johnvneun.com>`_, coach of FRC\\ |reg|"
" 148, and was initially designed for FRC calculations."

"It is fairly intuitive and can save a lot of time compared to doing "
"calculations on your own, especially when developing designs like arms, "
"linear slides, and drivetrains. This is as the balance between "
"power/torque and speed is critical to the end design. For example, arms "
"require much more torque than speed, while linear slides need very little"
" torque to maximize speed."

"To use the calculator for rotary mechanisms (arms), select the Rotary Arm"
" sheet. A good practice is to “pencil in” VEX’s dynamometer testing for "
"the bare NeveRest motor."

"**The VEX dyno test is a trusted and accurate resource for teams, even "

"The test results may be found by searching VEX Dyno Testing, or by "

"After entering in dyno data, change the :term:`gear ratio <Gear "
"Reduction>` in the sheet itself. The bottom left has a :term:`Gear "
"Reduction` page. Simply put the overall :term:`gear ratio <Gear "
"Reduction>` **of your gearbox** in the right side, keeping the one on the"
" left. For example for a NeveRest 20:1, write in “1” in the driving gear "
"column and “20” in the “driven gear” column. Then, add any external gear "
"ratios. For example, if the total ratio is 40:1, there should be a 1:2 "
"ratio in the driving:driven gear ratio below the 1:20. It doesn’t matter "
"whether it is 10:20, or 42:84 - only the proportion matters. This gives "
"you a lot of flexibility when looking for the right ratio. Additional "
"gear reductions can be added if needed."

"The same goes for linear mechanisms, with one additional note. The "
"calculator will ask for a pulley diameter, so provide the diameter of the"
" spool that the string is wound on. For a horizontal linear mechanism, "
"neglect stall load. For vertical linear mechanisms, only pay attention to"
" stall load if the mechanism will hang the robot."

msgid ""
"It is recommended that the factor of safety for a hang be 1.5-2x the "
"weight of the robot. Thus, the load should be 60-80+ pounds for a 40 "
"pound robot."

"A good starting point for non-hang extensions is around 6 in/sec, but "
"most teams will increase speed over time. It may be prudent to start "
"slower, though, to allow your driver to adjust to the speed before "
"increasing it."

"For 1-speed drivetrains, just enter in the correct motor specifications "
"and add in the total weight and wheel diameter. Don’t worry about the "
"efficiency and speed loss, just keep it where it is. The adjusted speed "
"will account for sag into field tiles, loss of efficiency through "
":term:`belts <HTD Belt>`, :term:`gears <Gear>`, etc., and loss of grip as"
" the wheels eventually wear out. A good starting point should be a free "
"speed of around 5 feet per second."

"You need to keep in mind the loaded current draw on your motor. Your "
"motor has a stall current of ~10 amps, so you don’t want to exceed that. "
"You also have a 20amp fuse on your battery, so make sure that you don’t "

"With each stage of :term:`gears <Gear>`, :term:`chains <Chain>` or "
":term:`belts <HTD Belt>`, you lose efficiency. Depending on how well you "
"build your system and what you are using, the percent loss changes. "
"However, generally it is around :math:`5\\%` per stage. Meaning that if "
"you had three stages of gears, your efficiency should be :math:`0.95^3`, "
"or approximately :math:`0.857` or :math:`85.7\\%`."
