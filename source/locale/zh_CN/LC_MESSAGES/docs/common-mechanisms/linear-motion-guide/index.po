"Linear motion is one of the most important components of a successful "
"robot. In most games, teams are required to reach into an area that the "
"drivetrain cannot access in order to pick up or deposit game elements. "
"For example, in 2017-2018, Relic Recovery, teams needed to extend an arm "
"of some sort to grab the Relic that was placed in the corner of the "
"playing field. This area of the game field was nearly impossible for a "
"robot to drive to, so a linear extension was necessary."

"It is possible to achieve extension with an arm, but since this guide is "
"geared toward newer teams, linear extensions should be prioritized over "
"arms. Refer to the :doc:`Arm Guide </docs/common-mechanisms/arms/index>` "
"for more information."
