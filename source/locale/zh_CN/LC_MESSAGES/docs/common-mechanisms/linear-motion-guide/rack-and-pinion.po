"Rack and pinion refers to a a toothed linear gear (the rack), meshed with"
" a a circular gear (the pinion gear). When the pinion gear is driven, it "
"will drive the pinion gear upwards or downwards, depending on how the "
"rack and pinion is mounted."

"Generally, rack and pinion is a good light-use option for FTC teams in "
"terms of linear extension. However, there are some disadvantages to rack "
"and pinion compared to the other options of linear extension. Therefore, "
"rack and pinion is generally not recommended for teams."
