"Continuous rigging entails rigging one long **extension string**, "
"originating from a motor-powered spool, to the top of the base stage, "
"then to the bottom of the first stage, then to the top of the first "
"stage, then to the bottom of the second stage, etc. A **retraction "
"string**, originating from a second spool on the same axis as the "
"extension spool, is then anchored to the top stage. When the motor "
"rotates one direction, the extension spool reels in the extension string,"
" so it becomes shorter. In doing so, the distance between the top of one "

"Once the last stage hits its limit, the next to last stage extends "

"extended. When the motor spins **in the opposite direction**, the "
"retraction string is reeled in, pulling the top stage closer to its "
"starting position until the system is back where it started. For the "
"retraction string, it is often necessary to add an extra pulley near the "
"back of the extension. This is because the retraction will only retract "
"to the farthest point, which generally is the spool. However, the spool "
"may not be mounted at the very back of the robot - thus an extra pulley "
"is needed. Note that for this to work, the extension string should be "
"wrapped around the spool in the opposite direction of the retraction "
"string. Thus, if the extension is wrapped clockwise, the retraction must "

"Tensioning string is one of the most painstaking tasks for a builder in "
"FTC. Ensuring that both sets of slides are tensioned evenly can be an "
"arduous and annoying job. However, adding tensioners to your strings can "
"help solve the uneven tension and ensure that both sides of slides run "
"together. The most common type of tensioner is a spring that can be "
"purchased at a hardware store. It generally will be placed at the end of "
"the string run, near the part that extends farthest out from the robot’s "
"center. By doing so, the string will stretch out when the spool extends "
"the arm, keeping tension so that the string does not detach from the "
"pulleys in the linear slide extension."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/linear-motion-guide/rigging.rst:176

"Another form of tensioner can be a spring-loaded pulley. Since the pulley"

"There are two main reasons that tensioners are highly recommended in "
"string based linear slides, the first and oftentimes more important one, "
"is that at its core, a run of string is a series of polygons, and as the "
"slide extends the effective size of that polygon changes. Meaning that "
"when fully extended, your slide may require more or less string compared "
"to when halfway extended. Or partially extended. The closer each set of "
"bearings are, the less this impracts string tension."

"Another (but less impactful) thing to keep in mind that spool size "
