"Extrusion slides are made up of a stack of extrusions that extend by "
"sliding along each other. There are two ways to make this happen: "
"bushings or V-wheels. Bushing slides connect the two slides with two "
"self-lubricating plastic pieces that slide smoothly along the slots in "
"the extrusion. V-wheel slides have V-shaped groove bearings on both sides"
" of the extrusion that bite intro grooves on the extrusion, allowing the "
"stages to slide smoothly."

"REV, Actobotics, and goBILDA all sell extrusion slide kits that integrate"

"V-wheel extrusion slide kit suitable for heavier loads, and Misumi offers"

" sells a 8020 V-groove bearing slide kit for FRC\\ |reg|, that is not "

"The `REV 15mm Linear Motion Kit "
"<https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-1507/>`_ is based on the 15mm "
"extrusion system. **This extrusion kit does not perform well without "
"modification.** This has been partially remedied by REV as they have "
"developed a second iteration of their slide kit, which has much better "
"tolerances on the Delrin sliders."

"Still, you’ll see some competitive teams use this kit with multiple "
"modifications, such as adding lots of lubricant and mounting the sliders "
"differently. Teams have also 3D printed their own sliders, though this is"
" not a great idea for teams without much 3D printing experience. One of "
"the biggest issues with the stock REV kit is the tendency of the slides "
"to bind. Additionally, since the only thing attaching one extrusion to "
"another is the plastic slider, the REV slides are not particularly "
"sturdy, and require crossbeams to keep alignment."

"Overall, this kit is lightweight, simple, and cheap. It can be a good "
"start for teams using REV and needing a linear extension, and is "
"generally usable out of the box. However, it is not very smooth and only "
"achieves its maximum potential when modified and tweaked."

"Actobotics' `X-rail Slide Kit <https://www.servocity.com/cascading-x"

"Teams will have to keep their designs on this kit particularly "
"lightweight. This slide uses elastic retraction through the use of "
"surgical tubing, which means that instead of having both an extend and "
"return string, there is a retraction force applied at all times. This "
"helps simplify tensioning and spooling, however, limits how fast the "
"slide can be run. Additionally, the plastic end caps have a reputation of"
" breaking regularly because they endure shock load every time the slide "
"extends to maximum. 3D printed alternatives may be more sturdy than the "
"stock end caps."
