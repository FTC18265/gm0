"You’ve *definitely* used a drawer slide before - at least two of them are"
" mounted to almost any drawer that you’ve opened. Teams use these drawer "
"slides for linear motion, often stacking them using 3D printed spacers to"
" achieve plenty of extension."

"These slides are available from a number of different vendors, and come "
"in many varieties, so choosing the right slide can seem overwhelming. "
"Steel drawer slides are common, but can be hard to mount, as they aren’t "

"Available from your local hardware store, steel slides aren’t a bad "
"option for FTC teams, as they are heavy-duty enough for most use cases. "
"However, these kinds of slides are much heavier than other aluminum slide"
" options. Furthermore, these slides are not designed to have bearings or "
"a second slide attached to them, because they only contain mounting for a"
" standard drawer. Thus, these slides require drilling holes in order to "
"mount the necessary parts for linear extension."

"They are also low-profile, and have a M3 mounting pattern, meaning they "

"To save space, some teams have 3D printed an insert that goes between "
