"Some teams have opted to build custom solutions for linear motion. Many "
"of these teams borrow concepts from FRC\\ |reg| teams, modeling their "
"elevators off of the tall systems found on the larger robots. There’s a "
"reason that many competitive FRC\\ |reg| teams build the same type of "
"elevator - at their scale, the box tube elevator has proven to be the "
"most efficient way to get game pieces off the ground at blisteringly "
"fast speeds."

"When built correctly, an elevator of this type can withstand hundreds of "
"pounds of load on any axis while barely weighing anything. However, "
"existing off-the-shelf options already fill the linear motion needs of "
"most FTC teams."

"Custom extension systems also require tons of work in CAD, hours upon "
"hours of manufacturing time, and may need multiple iterations before "
"they work correctly. Due to their complexity and how challenging they "
"are to design, less experienced teams may encounter significant "
"challenges."
