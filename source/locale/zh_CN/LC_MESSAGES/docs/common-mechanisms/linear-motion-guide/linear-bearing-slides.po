"Linear bearings are specialty ball bearings. Unlike radial ball bearings,"
" they run balls through cyclical tracks along the length of a rail or "
"shaft to create smooth, stable, precise linear motion. They are used in "
"many industrial automation systems, including 3D printers and CNC "
"machines."

"Unlike with most slides, the balls of linear bearings are not well "
"retained when the bearings are removed from their rails. Linear bearings "
"with a few balls missing have slightly decreased performance. Be sure to "
"handle and store the bearings with care and to be prepared if their balls"
" fall out."

"MGN linear bearing blocks are the most common linear bearing blocks in "

"HIWIN Corporation. They come in several sizes, the smallest being MGN7 "

"It is **recommended that teams only use MGN7, MGN9, and MGN12 slides.** A"
" pair of MGN12 slides is sufficient to lift a 40lb (20kg) robot. MGN9 "
"slides are similar in weight and scale to MiSUMI drawer slides. MGN7 "
"slides are smaller, but they are slightly more inconvenient to work with "
"because they use smaller M2 screws for mounting."

"If ordered directly through industrial supply centers such as HIWIN, "

"more reasonable prices through sellers on Amazon and eBay, although these"
" sellers may have questionable quality control. You can find more "
"information with a Google search of \"improving cheap MGN slides\""

"Round linear bearings are similar to bearing blocks and have similar "

"Round linear bearings can easily be sourced from most robotics suppliers,"
" including goBILDA and Actobotics. However, there are currently no out-"
"of-the-box lift kits using these bearings available from these suppliers."
" It is difficult to make a compact slide setup using only kit parts, and "
"for this reason most teams using round linear bearings use custom parts "
"to mount them."

"Many teams use round linear bearings with inexpensive aluminum and carbon"
" fiber tubes instead of steel tubes to save weight. Although slide "
"assemblies made this way are extremely light, they are prone to wearing "
"out over time as the steel balls wear into the softer materials. Teams "
"should keep this in mind and try to design their slide systems so that "
"the tubes can easily be replaced."
