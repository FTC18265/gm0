"Lead screws use a threaded rod to create high-torque linear motion. Their"
" primary advantage is being able to handle much higher loads than other "
"unmodified kit options. While this option was popularized in Rover Ruckus"
" for hanging robots, variations have been in use since as far back as "
"Res-Q. Another use case for lead screws is to change the angle of an arm "
"platform, though this is more common in FRC\\ |reg|. However, this "
"ability to handle high loads comes at a cost: lead screws are extremely "
"slow."

"By far the most popular lead screw option is the `ServoCity Linear "
"Actuator kit <https://www.servocity.com/linear-actuator-"
"kit-a-7-4-stroke-x-rail-piston/>`_. Overall, this kit is lightweight, "
"simple, and cheap. It can be a good start for teams using REV and needing"
" a linear extension, and is generally usable out of the box."
