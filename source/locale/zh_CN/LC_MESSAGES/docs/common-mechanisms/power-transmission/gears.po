"Gears, like sprockets and pulleys, are used in power transmission for "
"three common applications: changing the direction of power, changing the "
"amount of torque, and changing RPM. Gears are a less common transmission "
"option than chain, but are still very viable for most use cases. Gears "
"are equally as reliable as chain, but can’t be used for transferring "
"power over long distances. Many teams dislike gears when using kit-based "
"channels because the hole pattern limits which combinations of gears can "
"be used. Consequently, it may be difficult to achieve a desired specific "
"gear ratio. However, with :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` systems, it’s "
"very easy to use different ratios, since the gears can be moved around in"
" extrusion."

"Gears are made in different materials, with the most common being 7075 "
"aluminum. **Never mesh plastic and metal gears together**. It is "
"acceptable to mesh different types of metal gears together, as long as "
"they have the same diametral pitch. It is advised to stay away from "
"TETRIX aluminum gears as they wear down very easily. Some REV gears are "
"made out of Delrin, a self-lubricating plastic. It is a durable material,"
" but keep in mind that it is very possible to strip the bore using a "
"plastic gear. Thus, we advise using the REV Hex Hub Strengthener to avoid"
" stripping the bore on Delrin gears."

"Module refers to the amount of diametral pitch in millimeters per tooth. "

"When meshing gears, it is important that the gears are not too loose nor "

"decreasing its longevity. If the gears are too tight, however, they will "

"Calculating center-to-center distances using gears is quite simple. In "

"you must know the number of teeth for each gear and the **diametral "
"pitch** of your gears (the number of teeth per inch of the gear’s "
"diameter). With these two pieces of information, you can use the equation"
" :math:`D=\\frac{T_{1}+T_{2}}{P}`. In this equation, :math:`D` is the "
"distance between the center of both gears, :math:`T_1` and :math:`T_2` "

"The **module** (abbreviated **MOD**) of a gear is used similarly to "

"As with sprockets, it is important to line up the gears so that they do "

"**Gears are simple to use with both channel and extrusion**. On channel, "

"**Gears can give you big reductions in small areas**. Depending on the "

"**Gears require no tensioning: once the spacing is correct, the gears "
