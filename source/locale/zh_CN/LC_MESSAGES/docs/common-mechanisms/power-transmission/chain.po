"When your shafts aren’t right next to each other, roller chain and "
"sprockets will allow you to transmit power securely between your shafts. "
"Roller chain is made up of a series of links joined by pins. Each link "
"can rotate around its pins, creating a dynamic loop that can conform to "
"any shape. The pins in the chain engage the gaps between teeth on each "
"sprocket. If you’ve ridden a bike, chances are that you’ve already seen "
"roller chain - the chain on your FTC robot is similar, but it’s probably "
"a different :term:`pitch <Pitch>` (different size). Chains most commonly "
"used in FTC are #25 or 8mm pitch."

"When using chain, often there is a :term:`master link <Master link>`. "
"This is a special type of link that has a removable end capsule in order "
"to shorten the chain. However, as it is removable, it is not a very "
"reliable chain link and can loosen and fall off under prolonged usage. "
"There have been teams who have had master chain links fail during "
"competition, costing them a match in the elimination rounds."

"A :term:`chain breaker <Chain Breaker>` eliminates the need for master "

"**Chain should, at the very least, have 90° of contact with the sprocket."
" The best practice is to have 180° or more of contact**, as it is very "
"unlikely to fall off with proper tensioning. Chain skipping, especially "
"on drivetrains or arms, is very possible without proper chain wrap or "
"tensioning."

"When tensioning chain, be sure to not undertension or overtension chain. "
"Undertensioning chain can result in the chain falling off the sprocket or"
" chain skipping, where the chain can skip along the sprocket. "
"Overtensioning the chain often results in the motor burning out, or less "
"seriously, a loss of efficiency. Push along the chain run, and if the "
"chain moves slightly without significant resistance, chances are you’ve "
"done it correctly. If it’s too tight, then the chain will barely move "
"under a gentle press."

"**Chain can take a beating**. No matter what your application is, metal "
"chain is usually up for the challenge. #25 chain can hold up to 930lbs "
"before breaking, and there’s nothing you’ll do in FTC that will exert "
"that force. (If your chain does break, it’s most likely due to a faulty "
"Master Link or sprockets that are not correctly aligned.) * **Chain can "
"be however long or short as you wish**."

"**Chain can be pretty precise**. When properly tensioned, roller chain "
"doesn’t have very much slop. However, you really need to get your chain "
"tension right to reduce slop, and you’ll probably want an adjustable "
"tensioner for when the chain stretches. This can be done easily if using "
"extrusion systems, as the sprocket can be adjusted for tension."

"**Chain stretches over time**. As it’s used, the connections between the "
"links and rollers can stretch a bit. While it doesn’t look like much, "
"this stretching can introduce lots of slop into your chain run and even "
"derail it in some cases. You’ll most likely need an adjustable tensioner "
"to keep your tension over time - some teams have used spring-loaded "
"dynamic tensioners to automatically compensate for any changes."

"**The smaller the sprocket, the faster the chain stretch**. This is "

"applied due to a smaller radius."

msgid ""
"**Chain wrap, especially in one chain run, can be problematic**. "
"Typically, teams use either one or two chain runs (pieces of chain) per "
"drivetrain side. However, one chain run can require more than one idler "
"sprocket and get very complex in order to maintain proper chain wrap."

"**Sprockets are really big**. If you want a really high reduction using "
"chain, you’ll pay for it in the space that it takes up. Sprocket teeth "
"are much larger than gear or pulley teeth, so your reductions are going "
