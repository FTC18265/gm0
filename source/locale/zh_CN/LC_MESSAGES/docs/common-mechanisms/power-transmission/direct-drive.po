"Direct drive refers to powering a mechanical part (most commonly a drive "
"wheel) directly from the motor axis. Many new and inexperienced teams "
"will use this method to power their drivetrain as it is the simplest way "
"to do so. However, there are significant drawbacks to this method."

"First, direct drive puts unnecessary load on the drive motor. This is "
"because shock loads can destroy gearboxes, even :term:`planetary "
"gearboxes <Planetary Gear>`. Gearboxes are able to withstand load along "
"the axis of rotation, such as what occurs when the wheel changes "
"direction. This is a normal situation of load. However, in direct drive, "
"the gearbox shaft can be exposed to other shock loads outside of the "
"normal axis. This happens when the wheel comes into contact with another "
"robot or the field wall, which honestly happens more than you’d think. "
"This can bend the motor shaft or permanently damage the gearbox."

"Second, direct drive limits the :term:`gear ratio <Gear Reduction>` to "
"whatever ratio the motor gearbox is at. One advantage of all the other "
"three transmission systems is the ability to gear up or down, based on a "
"team’s needs. Direct drive cannot do so, and if your drivetrain uses 40:1"
" gearboxes, there is no way to reduce this ratio to a faster 20:1 "
"gearbox, for example."

"Third, motor shafts are not built to carry large amounts of downward "
"load. This can lead to bending of the motor shaft, since in direct drive "
"the shaft is only supported by one side, the gearbox. Generally, a "
"principle among all engineers is to support the shaft on both sides, "
"which isn’t possible in this case. This leads to :term:`cantilevering "
"<Cantilever>` the shaft, something that should be avoided in general. "
"Thus, with a heavy robot the motor shafts can easily be bent due to a "
"lack of support. (While typically it is impossible to support a motor "
"shaft on both ends, it is a common rule of thumb to have dual support on "
"wheels or other non-motor shafts.)"
