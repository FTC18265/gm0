"When you think of a belt, you’re probably thinking of a very important "
"men’s fashion accessory. However, there’s another type of belt, and it’s "
"way more relevant to robotics - the timing belt. If you’ve ever tinkered "
"with the insides of a car before, you probably recognize timing belts as "
"an important component designed to keep everything under the hood in "
"sync."

"While a timing belt may complete a similar objective to :term:`chain "
"<Sprocket>`, its characteristics and strengths are very different. Timing"
" belts use a series of small, wide teeth to engage a pulley with a number"
" of matching grooves. They earn their name because they can be very "
"precise, transmitting power with virtually no slop and ensuring a snug "
"connection between shafts. They’re lighter and more compact than chains, "
"but they lack the customizability of their bulkier brother - belts come "
"in a closed loop of predetermined length, and there’s no changing that "
"length on the fly."

"Like chain, belt is identified by its :term:`pitch <Pitch>` - common "

"When using timing belts, correct tension is very important. There are two"
" main ways to get your tension right. The first is easy - goBILDA and "
"Actobotics already have belts integrated into their hole patterns. You "
"can buy correctly sized belt directly from each vendor, and your tension "
"will be perfect as soon as the belt is installed. As your designs gain "
"complexity, so will your belt runs - maybe there are more than 2 pulleys,"
" and maybe your pulleys are all different sizes. To compensate for this, "
"the second way to ensure tension is to use a dynamic tensioner, similar "
"to those found in complex chain runs. To design for these tensioners, we "
"recommend planning more complex belt runs in CAD before building them in "
"real life."

":term:`Pitch Diameter (PD) <Pitch Diameter>` refers to the imaginary "

"**Belt should, at the very least, have 90° of contact with the pulley. "
"The best practice is to have 180° or more of contact**, as it is very "
"unlikely to fall off with proper tensioning. Belt skipping, especially on"
" drivetrains or arms, is very possible without proper belt wrap or "
"tensioning. When tensioning belt, be sure to not undertension or "
"overtension it. Undertensioning belt can result in the belt falling off "
"the pulley or belt skipping, where the belt can skip along the pulley. "
"Overtensioning belt often results in the motor burning out, or less "
"seriously, a loss of efficiency. Push along the belt, and if it moves "
"slightly without significant resistance, chances are you’ve done it "
"correctly. If it’s too tight, then the belt will barely move under a "
"gentle press."
