"A horizontal intake generally is a wider style of intake that has the "
"intake rotating on a horizontal axis or plane. Horizontal intakes are "
"generally used for intaking smaller game elements, as these types of "
"intakes can control more than one piece at a time. Horizontal intakes "
"have been used successfully in games such as Res-Q and Rover Ruckus, "
"where teams needed to pick up small cubes and balls from the floor."

"Roller and wheeled intakes refer to types of intakes which work by having"

"In this game, robots had to pick up glyphs, which were 6 inch foam cubes,"
" from the center pit and place them in the cryptobox. This game had many "
"wheeled intakes primarily because the wheels had consistent and "
