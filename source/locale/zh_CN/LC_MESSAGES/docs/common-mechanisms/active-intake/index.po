"There’s one main rule when it comes to intakes in FTC: you need one. "

"An intake is differentiated from a claw as an intake does not grasp "
"individual game elements using a pinching motion, but rather sucks the "
"element in through a variety of means such as wheels, tubes, etc."

"There are multiple parts of an effective intake: intake geometry, intake "
"type and material, and speed. However, a common rule of them is the "
"faster the intake, often the more effective it is. For example, near the "
"end of Rover Ruckus, many of the top performing teams used a 3.7:1 (1600 "
"RPM) motor or a 5.2:1 (1000 RPM) motor on their intake."

"When your intake comes in contact with game elements, you want it to "
"instantly control them. You should design with a margin for error, both "
"in the orientation of the game piece and in the alignment of the robot. "

"When this robot drives up to a ball, it barely has to point itself at the"
" ball before the ball is instantly locked in between the two rows of "
"wheels. What makes it so effective is the immense amount of testing that "
"went into its design. The team tried a number of intake shapes, initially"
" building with wood and rubber bands, and recorded which shapes were most"
" effective. By testing their intake design out before competition, they "
"didn’t have to guess whether it would work as intended: they put it on "
"the field with confidence."
