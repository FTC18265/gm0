"An intake must be reliable, as picking up and scoring game elements is "
"the primary method to gain points in all FTC games."

msgid ""
"Intakes have many moving parts and are susceptible to breaking, "
"especially at high RPM. Thus, the intake material must be durable to "
"withstand long periods of operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:11
msgid ""
"Intakes often stick outside of the robot frame perimeter. In this case, "
"durability becomes extremely important; the intake must be built so that "
"they can withstand impacts/collisions with other robots or parts of the "
"field."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:13
msgid ""
"There are two ways to accomplish this - either by building the intake "
"very robustly (lots of support so it doesn't break), or making the intake"
" flexible (for example out of lexan or spring loading it) so that even "
"though it may bend due to impacts, it will always spring back into place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:15

"Another way to prevent intake breaking is to make a fully retractable "
"intake that won’t protrude outside the 18” cube, though this is seldom "
"needed."

msgid ""
"The intake **must** be able to pick up game elements consistently and "
"quickly. For example, in Rover Ruckus each robot could only possess 2 "
"minerals at a time. Therefore, the intake should only pick up two pieces "
"at a time, not zero, one, or three."

"This is a common mistake that many inexperienced teams fail to take into "
"account."

"Another component is the varying angles that the game objects can be "
"located in. This was especially apparent in the Relic Recovery season, "
"where the “glyphs” (foam cubes) could be oriented in many directions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:26
msgid ""
"Even though it was relatively easy to make a compliant wheel intake that "
"could effectively intake glyphs in one direction, it was hard to make an "
"intake that could deal with angled glyphs. Being able to intake glyphs in"
" all orientations was especially important for multi-glyph autonomous "
"modes."

msgid ""
"The intake must be able to consistently control the game elements. For "
"example, if the intake is too fast and the collection box is not well "
"designed, then game pieces might fly out. If the intake is too slow, it "
"may jam itself when contacting the game elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:32
msgid ""
"It is possible for pieces to get jammed at an unreachable angle, "
"especially when using wheeled intakes. If this occurs, ensure that the "
"driver can jar the stuck element loose to avoid having a disabled robot."
msgstr ""

"Optimally, the game elements should follow a certain path each time if "
"funneling is done correctly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:34
msgid ""
"It is best practice that the driver can see the game elements which are "
"being controlled. This can be done through using clear plating such as "
"Lexan."

"The key to any successful robot is cycle time. Reducing cycle time by "
"having an efficient intake will lead to major improvements in score. A "
"good intake should take no more than a few seconds to successfully "
"collect the needed elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:41
msgid ""
"For example, in Relic Recovery, the best intakes often had a <3 second "
"collection time for two game elements, and in Rover Ruckus a 1 second "
"collection time was desired at the highest level."

"A key rule to remember in FTC is the shortest distance rule: how can you "
"get minerals from A to B in the shortest distance?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/active-intake/principles-of-an-intake.rst:44
msgid ""
"The answer is usually a couple straight lines. The closer the minerals "
"follow this path, the faster they will go from collection to deposit. "
"Don't make overly long routes unless needed."
