"In general, it is not recommended for teams to use 2 motors on the "
"drivetrain, but instead use 4. This is mainly due to the added power and "
"increased acceleration 4 motors provide."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/design-tradeoffs.rst:41
msgid ""
"Typically, top speed is determined by the gear ratio and the motor "
"specifications, not the number of motors. **However**, acceleration is "
"affected by the number of motors, and as FTC robots need to change "
"direction and accelerate numerous times per match, slow acceleration has "
"a significant adverse effect on the competitiveness of the robot. In "
"addition, 2 motor robots may struggle to get over obstacles or climb up "
"ramps, due to less power. One question that often comes up is \"don't I "
"need more motors for other things on the robot?\" This is a valid "
"question, but the answer is generally no. It is possible to build a "
"competitive robot with 4 motors allocated to drivetrain, and 4 motors for"
" other mechanisms, so there should be no reason to skimp. Do remember "
"that the drivetrain is the foundation of the robot. Your mechanisms will "
"not be anywhere near optimized if the drivetrain can't get your robot "
"from A to B quickly and efficiently. There has not been a game in FTC "
"history where the top robots needed >4 motors for the drivetrain, so this"
" is a pretty safe rule to follow."

"pick up anything in its path, if designed properly. Claws are also prone "
"to breakage, and thus suffer to defensive robots. They are also generally"
" more fragile than intakes. Therefore, active intakes are as a result "
"much more efficient than claws. Nearly every competitive robot from past "

"Teams are generally advised to stay away from arms and move in the "

"and are harder to implement properly."

"Arms require a high gear ratio, which usually in turn will require an "
"expensive gearbox (e.g. `VersaPlanetary "
"<https://www.vexrobotics.com/versaplanetary.html>`_) that teams on a "
"tight budget may not want to invest in. However, there are more "
"inexpensive options such as the REV UltraPlanetary gearbox to consider. "
"Furthermore, arms must be supported extremely well to bear the torque "
"that the motor provides. A poorly supported and/or constructed arm will "
"cause the driver needless pain as it is exceedingly difficult to line up "
"an arm that constantly shakes. In contrast, linear extensions do not need"
" to worry about gear ratios and gearboxes. They can be optimized to be "
"more efficient than arms, and typically are more precise, as linear "
"motion is easier to control than angular motion. Another positive is that"
" linear slides can have more extension than arms, with some reaching 5+ "
"feet in length."
