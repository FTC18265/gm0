"A chain bar arm is a special type of multi-axis arm that involves chain "
"hard-bolted to a bar. The purpose of a chain bar arm is to make an "
"extension such that the outer bar always keeps the same angle in "
"reference to the ground. This means that if the outer bar is parallel to "
"the ground in the stow position, it will remain parallel to the ground "
"at all points in the extension of the arm. This is especially important "
"if, for example, you have a claw to pick up an object, and you want the "
"claw to remain parallel to the ground."

"Chain bar arms can provide the >24\" optimal extension needed to be "
"competitive in games, but it also has disadvantages. It is much harder "
"to control than a linear slide, since a chain bar arm has momentum. "
"Thus, it is very difficult to be precise with a chain bar when stopping "
"the arm quickly."
