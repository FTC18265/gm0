"The most simple type of arm in FTC, a single arm refers to an arm on one "
"axis of rotation. While it is possible to successfully build this kind of"
" arm, generally a single axis arm will only afford around 15-16” of "
"extension, which is inadequate for nearly every game."

"The reason for this is that the longest a channel can be is 18” "
"(technically you could have a longer channel by placing it diagonally, "
"but this complicates matters). Thus, with a maximum of 18” of extension, "
"a couple inches must be subtracted, since the point of rotation is inside"
" the 18” sizing cube; therefore the extension is around 15-16”."

"Therefore, a single arm with further linear extension is optimal. For "
"example, some teams built a single arm with an added linear extension "
"mechanism to reach the desired extension length, which is generally >24”."

"The advantages of a single arm are that it is relatively easy to build, "
"and can be a quick way to gain some form of extension outside of the "
"robot cube."

"However, there are many disadvantages such as having a high gear ratio, "
"requiring much more support than a linear slide, and being hard to "
"control without the proper software."
