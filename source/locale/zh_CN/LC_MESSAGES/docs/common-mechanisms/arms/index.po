"Arms are another way to achieve extension past the 18” x 18” dimension of"
" the robot. Unlike linear extensions, arms require lots of torque - a "
"standard 40:1 or even 60:1 gearbox will not be suitable in most "
"applications. For example, many teams will run a 256:1 gearbox for their "
"rotation motor."

"Such motors must be very well supported, or else the motor may torque "
"itself free from its mount."

"Rarely should an arm be directly mounted to the driving motor. Instead, "
"torque should be transferred via gear, chain, or belt. Large arms can "
"also be hard to control (with the addition of momentum adding load to the"
" gearbox, it is hard to stop a three-foot arm that weighs five pounds "
"quickly without breaking a gearbox). In many cases, this issue can be "
"mitigated with software (see the :doc:`/docs/software/control-loops` "
"section)."

"Arms require an insane amount of torque, and in order to do so, teams "
"must purchase high-torque gearboxes, such as `UltraPlanetary gearbox from"
" REV <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1600/>`_, or the more expensive "
"VersaPlanetary (potentially Lite) and NeveRest Sport. One can also use "
"the high gear ratio `goBILDA planetary gearbox motors "
