"This section will cover the heart of any robot, the drivetrain. The "
"purpose of the drivetrain is to facilitate the movement of the robot, and"
" thus is crucial to the overall function of the robot. If the drivetrain "
"doesn’t work, the rest of the robot won’t work either. There are many "
"possible types of drivetrains in FTC, which we have covered in the guide."
" Drivetrains are split into two main types: tank (skid-steer) and "
"holonomic."

"A tank drivetrain primarily utilizes :term:`traction wheels <Traction "
"wheel>` and cannot strafe (move sideways). To change directions, a tank "
"drivetrain relies on either turning the wheels on the left and right side"
" in the opposite direction (thus spinning the robot) or running one side "
"faster than the other side (thus making the robot take the path of an "
"arc). Tank drivetrains prioritize traction and acceleration over pure "
"maneuverability, giving these drivetrains the potential to traverse "
"obstacles and play defense. Tank drivetrains are relatively simple to "
"build, yet are still competitive at the highest levels."

"A holonomic drivetrain, in contrast to a tank drivetrain, can move "
"sideways, due to using either :term:`mecanum <Mecanum Wheel>` or "
":term:`omni <Omni Wheel>` wheels. These kinds of wheels have special "
"rollers that allow strafing movements. Thus, holonomic drivetrains "
"prioritize movement over traction. Holonomic drivetrains eliminate the "
"time it takes to turn for a tank drivetrain. However, holonomic is "
"susceptible to defense and can suffer with a heavy robot. Holonomic has "
"been proven to be competitive at the highest level for many years, and is"
" common among world-class robots."

"When building any mechanism, teams must list out some necessities or "

"important for each drivetrain:"

msgid ""
"**Reliability**: Reliability, the key to success in *FIRST*\\ |reg| Tech "
"Challenge, starts with the drivetrain, the foundation to any robot. One "
"aspect of reliability to consider is the type of motor and gearbox that "
"is used in the drivetrain. For example, spur gearboxes are more likely to"
" break under load than a planetary gearboxes. (See the :doc:`/docs/power-"
"and-electronics/motor-guide/index` for details). Thus, spur gear motors "
"are not the optimal choice for drivetrain, especially if the robot is "
"projected to be on the heavy side (30+ pounds)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/index.rst:22
msgid ""
"Generally, more complex drivetrains pose more reliability challenges for "
"inexperienced teams. Our advice is to stick to the simpler drivetrains "
"such as 4 or 6 wheel drive and mecanum drive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Agility**: There are many factors to agility: top speed, acceleration, "
"turning radius, turn speed, and ability to strafe. Note that turning "
"radius is an often overlooked feature that is critical to the overall "
"agility of the drivetrain. Generally, a solid drivetrain should have a "
"free speed (speed under no load) in the range of 4.5-6 feet/second."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/index.rst:26

"A good resource to determine the agility of a drivetrain is the "
":doc:`/docs/power-and-electronics/motor-guide/jvn-calculator`; refer to "
"that section for more information."

"**Number of motors and gear ratio**: Generally, new teams may try to use "
"only two motors on the drivetrain. While this is possible, it is not "
"recommended, as all competitive teams use 4+ motors on the drivetrain. "
"Another issue stemming from experience is that most teams’ drivetrains "
"are too slow. More advanced teams may focus on the ability to play "
":term:`defense <Defense>`, but in general, maneuverability and speed are "
"the main factors to a successful drivetrain."

"60:1 and 40:1 motors are **almost always too slow for FTC drivetrain use "
"cases**. Any gear ratio between 16:1 and 20:1 is perfectly reasonable on "
"4 inch wheels. 19.2:1 on 4 inch wheels is a popular choice because it "
"enables one to go 1 to 1 off of a 19.2:1 planetary motor. This ratio "
"gives a great balance, having near instant acceleration and a high top "
"speed."

msgid ""
"On 3 inch wheels, the equivalent ratios are 12:1 to 15:1, which makes "
"13.7:1 on 3 inch wheels convenient, as it can be taken 1 to 1 off of "
"goBILDA's 13.7:1 planetary gearbox motor. Teams can slow the drivetrain "
"down in code by providing less power to the motors if needed."

"It is not recommended for teams to use spur gearboxes on their "
"drivetrain. Instead, use planetary gearboxes, as they are less prone to "
"shock loads and breakage."

"**Traction/Pushing Power**: While this feature is often overemphasized, "
"it is still very important. Pushing power describes a drivetrain’s "
"ability to endure defense/engage in defense. In addition, traction will "
"be important if the drivetrain must traverse obstacles or some sort of "
"terrain. Many factors affect the pushing power of a drivetrain, including"
" wheel type, motor gearing, and overall weight of the robot."

"**Powering the drivetrain**: Generally, there are four options for power "

"We recommend belted drivetrains, but realize that belt is a difficult "

"CAD or a detailed sketch is generally recommended with chain in order to "
