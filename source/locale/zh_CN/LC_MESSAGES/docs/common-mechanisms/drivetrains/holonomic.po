"Mecanum drivetrains consist of four mecanum wheels which are powered "
"independently by one motor. This configuration angles the velocity of each "
"wheel, allowing the robot to strafe."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/holonomic.rst:11
msgid ""
"The primary advantage to mecanum drive is the maneuverability it affords, "
"especially because the robot can strafe instead of turn and drive. The "
"rollers on mecanum wheels form a 45 degree angle with the wheel’s axis of "
"rotation, which means that mecanum drivetrains can’t strafe as fast as they "
"can drive forward."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/holonomic.rst:13
msgid ""
"This can be explained by discussing the forces involved. When each wheel "
"rotates, it applies a friction force to the ground, which moves the robot. "
"When moving forward, both sets of left wheels rotate in the same direction at "
"the same speed, and both sets of right wheels rotate in the same direction at "
"the same speed, meaning that the forces do not oppose each other. However, "
"when strafing, neither the two left wheels nor the two right wheels are "
"rotating at the same speed. In many cases, they even rotate in opposite "
"directions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/holonomic.rst:15
msgid ""
"These two opposing forces cause the rollers to slip more and more, which "
"angles the robot’s velocity at the expense of traction (more slipping results "
"in a loss of speed). However, the wheels do still slip when moving forward "
"but not as drastically as they do when strafing."

"This is the primary disadvantage to mecanum drivetrains: they tend not to "
"have much pushing power and thus, are vulnerable to defense by a sturdy tank "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/holonomic.rst:19

"Due to the fact that mecanum wheels are more likely to slip because of the "
"diagonal rollers, an optional addition to mecanum drives is a separate "
"odometry mechanism in order to track the robot’s location during autonomous."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to note that in order to maximize the efficiency and "
"stability of mecanum drives, when viewed from above, the rollers of each "
"wheel should point towards the center of the robot, forming an X shape, "
"rather than a rhombus."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/common-mechanisms/drivetrains/holonomic.rst:25
msgid ""
"The primary reason for this is that it allows the drivetrain to turn "
"significantly faster than it would otherwise be able to. When using the "
"suggested setup, when viewed from the robot’s underside, the rollers form a "
"rhombus. This allows the force applied by the wheels on the ground to act "
"tangent to the turn radius, leading to faster turning."

"One notable difference between X-Drive and mecanum is strafe speed. While, as "

"H-Drive (also known as U-drive, depending on the configuration) is a "
