"A 6 wheel drivetrain is a common competitive drivetrain in FTC for multiple "

"the drivetrain has more contact with the ground, helping with stability and "

"A drop center 6WD is a 6 wheel drive with the center wheel mounted slightly "

"The purpose of dropping the middle wheel is to ensure that only 4 wheels are "
"in contact with the ground at all times. This is because turning with 6 "

"Moreover, **most drop center 6 wheel drives are made using custom "

"Actobotics using pillow blocks, but it is a little bit more awkward. "

"6 wheel drives with corner :term:`omni wheels <Omni Wheel>` do not need to "
