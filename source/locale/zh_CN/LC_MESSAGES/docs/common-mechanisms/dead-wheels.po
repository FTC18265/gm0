"The term dead wheels, tracking wheels, odometry pods, and odometry are often conflated "
"in the FTC community. However, there are a few key differences one must keep in mind. "
"Odometry is an umbrella term and refers to the general use of motion sensors for "
"localization purposes. Meanwhile, dead wheels, tracking wheels, and odometry pods are "
"all synonymous terms. We'll explore what they mean in a bit."

"Odometry refers to the use of motion sensors for localization. Localization is a means "
"for being able to locate the position of the bot at some point in time. Localization is "
"crucial in path following and advanced autonomous modes as one needs to know where they "
"are to generate the necessary movements needed to reach a desired destination. :doc:"
"`Localization software </docs/software/odometry>` plays a major role in odometry; "
"however, in order to produce accurate results, reliable and accurate hardware design is "
"a necessity."

"The simplest form of odometry is drive encoder localization. This is the use of "
"encoders measuring the rotation of motors that power the drive train. One is able to "
"read the encoder data and feed it through the kinematic equation for that specific "
"drive train to derive the body's velocity. Drive encoder localization is generally "
"quite simple and easy to setup as almost all of the FTC legal motors have built-in "
"encoders. Getting drive encoder localization setup is simply a matter of plugging in "
"wires, no additional hardware needed."

"Many teams in the community have converged on a unique solution that isn't seen very "
"much outside of FTC: the use of \"dead wheels,\" \"tracking wheels,\" or \"odometry pods"
"\" (these terms are all synonymous). These refer to small \"dead\" or non-driven (not "
"powered by a motor) wheels attached to an `encoder sensor <#encoders>`_. Two or three "
"dead wheel pods are often sprung to the ground to ensure accurate tracking. The two-"
"wheel design utilizes one parallel and one perpendicular pod (parallel and "
"perpendicular with respect to the drive wheel axis), measuring x and y movement "
"respectively. Change in heading is measured via a gyroscope. The three-wheel design "
"utilizes two parallel and one perpendicular pod, measuring x and y movement "
"respectively. However, this design forgoes the gyroscope and instead measures heading "
"via the difference with the two parallel wheels. This is often more accurate in the "
"context of the FTC control system because the BNO055 IMU (used for the gyroscope in the "
"two-wheel design) utilizes I2C which is slower than the rest of the I/O on the REV Hub "
"and cannot be bulk read. These two issues lead to minute drift issues which can "
"compound over time, thus leading to a more inaccurate localization system when using "
"the two-wheel design."
