"For almost any programming language, whether it’s Java, Python, or "
"Blocks, there are concepts in coding that transfer across languages. "
"These ideas are foundational when learning to program and should be "
"applicable in FTC and beyond."

"This section is primarily for people with limited Java experience. "
"However, even if you are more experienced, it may still be helpful to "
"skim through the section, as you might find concepts that have not yet "
"been introduced to you."

"Be sure to familiarize yourself with basic control structures (if/else "

"structures are by far the most commonly encountered, and thus, "
"familiarizing yourself with these principles is extremely important (not "
"just for FTC, but programming in general). However, there are a few "
"control structures that are far less common that are extremely useful in "

"Data structures are a method of organizing and storing large amounts of "

"If you wish to expand an array, a new one must be created and all of the "
